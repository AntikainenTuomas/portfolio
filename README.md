# Game Developer

### Education
- I have completed comprehensive school.
- I have graduated from high school.
- I am currently in my second year of studying ICT with a major in game development at Metropolia university of applied sciences.

### Projects
I worked on a small group project where we developed a game during my first year of school. The game was initially created using Python and later remade and elevated with JavaScript.

During second year I worked on a solo game project where the goal was to create my own version of an existing game. The game I based my project on was Arkanoid. You can see it here --> https://tuomas-antikainen.itch.io/brickpop
